# HYMN-
Hymn  Our app is called Hymn for it provides the users with the lyrics of songs. According to the current status of worship in Christian religions there is a great demand of the lyrics of the songs. In order to maintain the need of the people, we came up with the app called HYMN.  If the lyrics are given for the people with a paper or any other manual way the amount of the cost will definitely be a lot. So instead of that manual way we brought an app which any body can download and use simply,flexibly, and quickly at low cost.               What HYMN does? This app provides a lyrics of songs in a different view. It also let's the user to search specific song. This search task may be in number,title,first line...etc. The app will also let's the users to select their favorite song and marks it. Finally the last but not the list significance is the fact that it gives interactive user interface.
